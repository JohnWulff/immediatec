            GIT Automatic Id Keyword Expansion

There has been much discussion about the pros and cons of Keyword
Expansion and its absence in GIT. The attitude of the GIT developers
is, that groups of files should always be looked at as a unit and
at any point in time a commit operation generates a snapshot of all
the files in the project as they were at that point in time. Previous
commits can be checked out - reconstituting the whole project as it was
at that time. I agree that this is a very valid point and older VCSs
suffered, because of their emphasis on versioning individual files and
not having useful facilities for handling change sets. SCCS and RCS
as well as its offshoot CVS do not handle changesets automatically.
They rely on tags, which are often forgotten and are nearly impossible
to add later.

I accept the GIT work flow, which is to produce combined diffs or patch
sets of modifications in all files which are committed together. This
set provides the history of a certain idea cast into code, which may
be spread over a number of files. This work flow does require a lot
of discipline though to make sure that commits are done before any
new ideas are started (commit often cannot be stressed enough).

To support an alternative workflow, that many programmers are used
to I propose the following Perl and Bash scripts for GIT automatic
$Id keyword expansion (gaIdke), which act together to increment and
update version numbers in $Id strings in a similar way to that which
is carried out in RCS, CVS or SVN. These scripts have no effect on
any sources which do not contain a $Id string. GIT will act normally
in every way for these sources. Only when a $Id string is placed in
a source will the automatic incrementing of version numbers come into
effect (this is similar to RCS etc).

The format of the generated <version> strings are very similar to
those generated by RCS/CVS, namely full stop separated pairs of major
and minor versions:

* the first string is the major version number in the master branch.
* even strings are consecutive version numbers in the branch.
* odd strings identify branches (branch names or numbers).

The following are a sequence if $Id strings for the file xx.c after
a series of 3 edit/commits in the 'master' branch followed by 2
edit/commits in branch 'bx' followed by an edit/commit in branch
'by':

$Id: xx.c 1.1 $
$Id: xx.c 1.2 $
$Id: xx.c 1.3 $
$Id: xx.c 1.3.bx.1 $
$Id: xx.c 1.3.bx.2 $
$Id: xx.c 1.3.bx.2.by.1 $

After 'smudging' the last $Id would look like this:

$Id: xx.c 1.3.bx.2.by.1 30e82ef 2016-04-03 14:48:24 +1000 Joe Blow $

This automatic method if $Id keyword expansion shows the file name,
the branch in which an instance of a file was edited and its version
number within that branch.  This information is embedded in the text
of a file in a manner, which is fully compatible with GIT. After
smudging the $Id also shows the commit SHA-1, the date and the author
of the file instance. The $Id information in each file provides an
independent view, which can be regarded as a belts and braces approach
to handling files in GIT.

=====   The following scripts make up the gaIdke package:

gaIdke.clean:

        remove git SHA-1 hash, iso commit date and author name before
        the final $ of a correctly smudged $Id string, which is
        '$Id: <filename> <ver> <hash> ...$'.
        <filename> and <ver> can be any non white-space characters except
        <filename> and <ver> may not start with a $ to prevent a Heisenbug.
        <hash> is any length word consisting of lower case hex digits.

        Only $Id strings which contain a white-space separated <hash> in
        the right place are cleaned. This makes sure that any $Id strings
        imported from legacy repositories are not modified.

        'clean' is called by numerous git operations, in particular by
        'git add', 'git status' and 'git diff'. This ensures that
        files containing smudged $Id strings compare correctly with
        committed versions.

gaIdke-pre-commit:

        Obtain the list of files currently being committed (staged) and
        not modified since they were added to the index (not dirty).
        Back up each file in this list and rewrite the file - scanning
        for $Id lines.

        If a $Id string is found, increment the last number in <ver>
        of any $Id: <path> <ver> line in the file and replace any
        text between <ver> and a final $ by one space.  <path> is
        obtained from a 'git diff --name-only --cached' command,
        which is the list of files staged for commit.  If a file has
        been renamed, the new path is written in the $Id: string.
        The file will be committed with the updated clean $Id line.

	For a a new file yy.c containing "$Id$" only, gaIdke.pre-commit
	expands this to "$Id: yy.c 1.1 $" to start the process.

        The above applies if the commit is executed in the master branch.
        Special handling applies if the commit is executed in any other
        branch. If the file was never modified in this branch (say 'bx')
        and was originally generated in the master branch and is the 3rd
        version of 'filename' the following Id applies: "$Id filename 1.3".
        After this file has been edited in this branch 'bx' and commited,
        'pre-commit' will generate a new Id incorporating the branch name:
        "$Id: 1.3.bx.0", which will be incremented to "$Id: 1.3.bx.1".
        After another edit and a commit this would become "$Id: 1.3.bx.2".
        If you now move to yet another branch (say 'by') and edit the same
        file in that branch and commit Id would become "$Id: 1.3.bx.2.by.1".

        A new file zz.c in branch 'bx' will start with "$Id: zz.c 1.1.bx.1".

        To avoid long $Id strings with branches, it is advisable to use
        short branch names when using $Id: keyword expansion.

        Finally append the path and modified version to .gitSmudgeList.
        This list is stored for use by post-commit for a 'checkout' and
        'smudge' of modified files.  The information in .gitSmudgeList
        is also used by 'prepare-commit-msg' to pre-format a list of
        $Id incremented files as a tail for the commit message. This
        is not optional because 'smudge' uses this information in
        the log to find the right commit for this version of the file.

        If no $Id string is found, the backup of the file is restored
        and that path is not recorded in .gitSmudgeList. This means
        that file will not be smudged in post-commit and because
        it's modify date is not changed here or in post-commit, the
        file will not trigger a subsequent 'make'. The operation is
        completely transparent to GIT for this case.

        $Id keyword expansion can be suppressed by placing the string
        $IdBlockFurtherExpansion$ after an initial $Id keyword line,
        which will be expanded and before any line containing $Id$ or
        $Id: <path> <ver> $, which would otherwise be expanded. This is
        only required for files like this one describing $Id features.

gaIdke-prepare-commit-msg:

        Obtain the list of files which have been updated with an
        incremented <ver> in pre-commit from .gitSmudgeList. Each
        smudgeLine in .gitSmudgeList is formatted as follows by
        pre-commit:

            <path> <ver>
          or
            <path> <ver> <- <previous_filename>

        These lines preceded by '    Id: ' are added before the first
        comment of the new commit message. No lines are added for any
        files in the commit, which do not have a $Id string.

gaIdke-reset:

        To recover modified files containing $Id lines after aborting
        a commit by competely clearing the commit message execute
        '.git_filters/gaIdke-reset' (an empty commit message aborts
        a commit in GIT).

        At that point the files in the working directory which have
        been staged will have cleaned and incremented $Id lines, but
        there will also be a backup copy of each of these files with
        the suffix .gaidke. To recover the state before the aborted
        commit, each of the .gaidke backup files is moved back to the
        original working file, but only if the working file has not
        been changed since the aborted commit. Also the recovered
        files are staged again with 'git add'.

        If a staged file has been changed and a .gaidke file for it
        exists, only the $Id line must be copied back to that file and
        staged again.

        Files which are staged to be deleted can be ignored. They have
        already been removed from the working directory.

gaIdke-post-commit:

        Obtain the list of files which have been updated with an
        incremented <ver> in pre-commit from .gitSmudgeList. Execute
        'git checkout HEAD' to call smudge so the file in the working
        directory will have a $Id with an incremented <ver> followed
        by the commit hash, the author commit date and the author name.
        Also remove the backup file here.

gaIdke.smudge <p1>
        <p1> path of the file to be smudged relative to GIT base.

        Insert git SHA-1 hash, iso commit date and author name before the
        final $ of a clean $Id string, which is '$Id: <filename> <ver> $'.
        <filename> and <ver> can be any non white-space characters except
        <filename> and <ver> may not start with a $ to prevent a Heisenbug.

        Only 'clean' $Id strings are smudged. This makes sure that any
        $Id strings imported from legacy repositories are not modified.

        'smudge' is called by 'git merge', 'git checkout' and indirectly
        by 'git pull', git clone' and 'post-commit'.

        To find the right commit for this file and version in case this
        script is called for a non HEAD commit, the whole log has to be
        scanned for 'Id: file ' inserted by gaIdke-prepare-commit-message.
        This search may fail in which case it is corrected in 'post-checkout'.

gaIdke-post-checkout:

        Same script used for 'post-checkout' and for 'post-merge'.

        For every file, which has a $Id line but whose Id could not be
        found in the log, 'smudge' outputs the files path to .gitSmudgeFailed.

        This happens in 'git checkout branch' when branch is above the
        branch we are coming from, because HEAD is not moved until after
        the checked out files have been smudged after 'git checkout'.

        This filter is called after the checkout is complete and
        HEAD has been moved. It calls'post-commit' to smudge the
        files correctly.

        This filter is only run once after a checkout to break an
        infinite loop, by blocking writing to .gitSmudgeList in 'smudge'
        when 'post-commit' is called from this filter, which calls
        'git checkout' again which calls 'smudge' with the correct HEAD.
        This should not happen with a correct HEAD but you never know.

gaIdke-post-merge:    ## symlink to .git_filters/gaIdke-post-checkout ##

        Called after a 'git merge' or a 'git pull' - I presume because
        'git pull' is equivalent to 'git fetch; git merge FETCH_HEAD'.

        The problem when 'smudge' is executed after a 'git pull' for
        the modified files, HEAD has not been adjusted yet to the position
        after the rebase. This is the situation after 'git fetch':

                d--e       <-- FETCH_HEAD
        a--b--c            <-- HEAD

        This is the situation after the merge at which point modified
        files are checked out and smudged incorrectly, because HEAD
        still points at the old commit and 'smudge' uses 'git log',
        which starts looking at HEAD and thus cannot find the commits
        d' and e' which contain the details for the modified files.

                d'--e'     <-- FETCH_HEAD
               /
        a--b--c            <-- HEAD

        This is the situation after files have been checked out and
        a rebase has been done. At this point 'post-merge' is called
        and the newly fetched files can be smudged correctly.

        a--b--c--d'--e'    <-- HEAD
              ^--------------- ORIG_HEAD

gaIdke-activate:

        Script to activate 'Automatic GIT Id Keyword Expansion'.

        Execute '.git_filters/gaIdke-activate' after cloning a project
        containing 'Automatic GIT Id Keyword Expansion' gaIdke, to place
        the correct symlinks in .git/hooks, and write a [filter "gaIdke"]
        entry in .git/config.

        If '.git_filters/gaIdke-activate -global' is executed also copy
        all the files in '.git_filters' to '/usr/local/share/git_filters',
        symlink the hooks to them and write a global [filter "gaIdke"]
        entry in ~/.gitconfig.

        This way you can use 'Automatic GIT Id Keyword Expansion' in
        other GIT projects, although you need to copy all the files in
        '.git_filters' to another project if you want to publish it.

        To automate this activation I have placed the following code towards
        the end of every 'configure' script for projects containing the
        gaIdke hooks. This means GAIDKE is active as soon as the 'configure'
        script is run for a newly cloned project.

        # do gaIdke-activate if cloned GIT with gaIdke
        git_base=$(git rev-parse  -show-toplevel 2> /dev/null)
        if [ -n "$git_base" \
            -a -f "$git_base/.git_filters/gaIdke-activate" \
            -a ! -e "$git_base/.git/hooks/post-checkout" \
            -a ! -e "$git_base/.git/hooks/post-commit" \
            -a ! -e "$git_base/.git/hooks/post-merge" \
            -a ! -e "$git_base/.git/hooks/pre-commit" \
            -a ! -e "$git_base/.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg" ]; then
            . $git_base/.git_filters/gaIdke-activate
        fi

Environment:
        export GAIDKE=verbose # output extra debug messages.
        export GAIDKE=Verbose # output even more debug messages.
        export GAIDKE=        # no debug output.

===========================================================================

GIT automatic $Id Keyword Expansion has been implemented in the
immediate C project at https://github.com/JohnWulff/immediatec and can
be copied from there. Simply copy the folder .git_filters to your own
project Git base folder. Your folder .git_filters should now contain
the following files:

    .git_filters/gaIdke-README
    .git_filters/gaIdke-activate
    .git_filters/gaIdke-post-checkout
    .git_filters/gaIdke-post-commit
    .git_filters/gaIdke-pre-commit
    .git_filters/gaIdke-prepare-commit-msg
    .git_filters/gaIdke-reset
    .git_filters/gaIdke.clean
    .git_filters/gaIdke.smudge

To activate  GIT automatic $Id Keyword Expansion, run the script
.git_filters/gaIdke-activate, which executes the following actions:

    cd <project>/.git/hooks/
    ln -sf ../../.git_filters/gaIdke-post-checkout post-checkout
    ln -sf ../../.git_filters/gaIdke-post-commit post-commit
    ln -sf ../../.git_filters/gaIdke-pre-commit pre-commit
    ln -sf ../../.git_filters/gaIdke-prepare-commit-msg prepare-commit-msg
    ln -sf ../../.git_filters/gaIdke-post-checkout post-merge

  adds the following line to <project>/.gitattributes
    * filter=gaIdke

  adds the following [filter] lines to .git/config
  or to ~/.gitconfig for all projects
    [filter "gaIdke"]
    clean  = .git_filters/gaIdke.clean
    smudge = .git_filters/gaIdke.smudge %f

To automate the activation of gaIdke, when your project is
cloned by somebody else, you may want to add a safe call to
.git_filters/gaIdke-activate to your "configure" script as described
above in gaIdke-activate.

===========================================================================

Justification and historical remarks

Because I have always felt change sets are extremely important,
I developed scripts to automatically generate change sets for RCS
or CVS in the early 80's and these have been very successful to
maintain consistency in my projects. Nevertheless I feel strongly that
there is a place for individual version numbers following more than a
hundred year old tradition of drawing office practice in engineering,
which can be described in a nutshell as follows:

    1. Each part to be manufactured is described by a drawing having
    a "name" and a "version number", which is incremented
    every time the drawing is changed and with signatures to provide
    an audit trail.

    2. Each assembly is described by a parts list (change set) of
    drawing names with the current "version numbers" to build a
    functioning product. Such parts lists also have a "version
    number", which is incremented every time the parts list is
    changed.

The outcome of this is, that engineers traditionally use both
individual version numbers for parts and whole lists, and parts
lists to describe change sets. Unfortunately when Software Version
Control Systems were introduced with SCCS and RCS in the early
80's, programmers only had tools to do the automatic versioning
of parts - that is individual files and no automatic support for
change sets. Today GIT has come along and does the exact opposite:
it provides automatic versioning for change sets only and does not
provide monotonically increasing version numbers for individual files
making up those change sets.

To prove that this can be remedied I have written a set of hooks
for GIT, which does real version number incrementing for every file
that contains a well formatted $Id string, every time such a file
is changed and committed. These hooks have absolutely no effect on
files not containing a $Id string.

What the GIT developers forget is the fact that most programmers find
it hard to always concentrate on the complete set of sources at all
times and indeed they should not be forced to do so. When coding or
merging one necessarily deals with one file although there might be
cases where code in a number of files may be co-dependent and need to
be edited together. But such a design is flawed in my view and should
be avoided at all costs. The interface between functions or classes
should be determined first and documented in a reasonably detailed
comment block before coding even starts. Co-dependent functions
should be gathered in one source file. Then each source file can be
coded individually, concentrating with the mind on good algorithms for
implementing the global pre-determined interface. What I am trying to
say is, that it is good programming practice to get the details of
the functions in one source file right by following the development
of the changes made in those functions over a number of individual
file versions. The version numbers of a source file provides a good
mental trigger to the sequence of that development.  I maintain that
this is a valid work flow and programmers who choose to follow this
work flow should be able to do so in GIT. Standard GIT enforces a
different work flow and it may not always be comfortable.  The global
picture of all the files making up a project working together is very
important, but it becomes important at a different time and possibly
for different people (during integration and commissioning).

As a trained engineer I was very much aware of this in the late 80's
and developed a method for automatically generating change sets for
SCCS and later for RCS. This method relies on $Id strings with filename
and version numbers embedded in every source file of a project. RCS
automatically increments the minor version number in any $Id string
of a file every time that file is committed (ci). If the code of any
source file, which is compiled is organized in such a way, that the
$Id string is embedded in a character array, which becomes part of a
compiled object file and linked executable then one way to extract
those $Id strings from such an executable is to execute ident(1)
followed by sort -u and a small amount of formatting. A script I have
written called mkv does just that. Here is an example of a small C
executable 'iCgpioPUD' made up of just three source files:

ident iCgpioPUD    # produces

$Id: bcm2835.h,v 1.19 2015/03/30 23:01:11 jw Exp $
$Id: iCgpioPUD.c,v 1.2 2015/04/11 09:30:33 jw Exp $
$Id: bcm2835.c,v 1.22 2015/03/29 08:14:44 jw Exp $
$Id: bcm2835.h,v 1.19 2015/03/30 23:01:11 jw Exp $

mkv iCgpioPUD    # produces

$Id$
bcm2835.c       1.22    2015/03/29  08:14:44  jw      Exp
bcm2835.h       1.19    2015/03/30  23:01:11  jw      Exp
iCgpioPUD.c     1.2     2015/04/11  09:30:33  jw      Exp

Note how bcm2835.h appears twice in the 'ident' output but
only once in the mkv output, which is a change set or a parts list,
a term used in engineering. A complementary script cov checks out
all the source files in such a change set or parts list from the RCS
repository. The crucial aspect of this method is, that every executable
has the versioned parts list of all its source files embedded in it
once the $Id string arrays have been set up in every source file:

static const char bcm2835_c[] =
"$Id$";

which is changed after the first RCS commit (ci) to

static const char bcm2835_c[] =
"$Id: bcm2835.c,v 1.1 2014/05/05 08:55:00 jw Exp $";

Over the years this work flow has proved very reliable, because it is
automatic - one cannot forget to create the parts list or change
set unlike a tag. It is very fast in tracking down bugs reported by
customers by using diff between files extracted with mkv/cov from
the customers version of a delivered executable and more recent
versions. CAVEAT: executables delivered to customers must be built
from source files that have been checked in.

It seemed only natural to generate a comprehensive parts list xxx.v
with mkv at every release point for project xxx and to also version
xxx.v. As can be seen in the output above mkv already generates the
$Id$ string for this to happen automatically.  The version number
of the xxx.v parts list is used by me as the version number of
the release.  Tagging, which is normally used for this purpose is
not quite as useful as a versioned parts list xxx.v - different
versions of such a parts list can be diffed to see immediately which
source files have changed from one release to another.

Admittedly GIT deals with all the issues around change sets and is a
great distributed version control system. That is why I am migrating
to it now.  For my projects I was able to use the regular versioned
xxx.v parts lists, which define change sets in the 20 year history
of my RCS projects to build accurate historical GIT repositories
using 'cvs-fast-export' after massaging the RCS version files
with commitids built from the change set information. Nevertheless
there are a number of good reasons to continue using automatically
incremented version numbers in $Id strings for some files in GIT.

In most software projects there usually are a number of independent
interpreted scripts consisting of single file executables, which do not
have to be built. Such scripts should be identified by an independent
version number, if their operation is not directly related to other
programs in a project. To do things correctly in the GIT way, such
scripts should always be committed by themselves, so that the commit
can be tagged with an individual version identifier. This is a lot to
think of and I imagine is not regularly practised. For such cases an
automatically incremented version number can be very useful. Programs
should also be in a position to report their version. It is very easy
to do with $Ids - simply embed the $Id string in the -help or
-version string. This also makes the $Id accessible to ident and mkv.

As mentioned earlier, there is a long engineering tradition of
maintaining version numbers for all objects making up a product.
The equivalent of a source file in engineering is a technical drawing.
In 1957 I spent half a year in a drawing office as an engineering
apprentice. The chief draughtsman impressed upon me the importance
of documenting every change to a drawing, which was marked on
the drawing by a change or version number, duly signed off by the
draughtsman and after inspection by his boss. I also learned about
parts lists, which had to be kept current to show the latest drawing
version numbers which worked together. Any change to a parts list was
also versioned. The whole process was supervised by the responsible
engineer.  When manufacturing a product in a factory it is essential
that extreme care is taken to guarantee the working of the final
product. Because the cost of failure is high, engineers are very
disciplined about these matters.

A major problem with software development is the fact that the cost
of failure appears, at first sight, to be relatively low - a few
changed lines seem to fix most problems. Unless those changes are also
documented and versioned it is very hard to find them again later.
If it turns out that those changes have unforseen side effects in the
overall system they can become very costly, if the changes cannot be
located quickly.

Up till the 70's programmers were rather slack with regard to backing
up and versioning and it was not till the 80's with the advent of
SCCS and RCS that a need for versioned backups was felt necessary
or indeed became possible. Here are a couple of war stories to give
younger programmers a feel of how things were in those days.

    1. In 1975 I was chief engineer for a computer company in Germany
    that sold minicomputer based systems for commercial computing. I
    was also responsible for maintaining the 16 user time-sharing
    OS, which had been developed in assembler by a California based
    company. The system was rather fragile and I never received
    any sources so I was forced to do maintenance with a symbolic
    debugger and disassembler, which I had written. I later found
    out that the California company had no up to date sources either,
    because their main developer used to make changes with the debugger
    using backpacks, which are new code written with the debugger in
    high memory. A JMP to the backpack would be inserted at the point
    of a bug. The end of the backpack had a JMP to a point past the
    bug. I was told on good authority that he would produce up to 15
    backpacks in an afternoon, some of them being backpacks on top
    of backpacks. None of this code was ever written up as assembler
    source code. The discs containing the patched binaries were simply
    copied and sent to customers.  (The backpacks were very obvious
    on disassembly).

    2. In 1987 I started work with a PLC manufacturer. The group
    leader of the software department assured me that he could
    remember all the changes that had been made and that there was
    no need for backups. Admittedly backup memory was at a premium
    then. There was a major disaster a few weeks later. The programming
    software for the companies Programmable Logic Controllers, which
    had been delivered to a large car manufacturer turned out to be
    buggy. The customer did not report these bugs until 6 weeks after
    delivery. By this time the sources for the programming software had
    been modified and extended and were not in any state to be run. No
    backups had been kept and many days and nights were spent trying
    to reproduce the software that had been delivered from memory and
    then work out what was going wrong. SCCS, which I had already been
    using for a number of years at another company was gratefully
    accepted after this incident. I also developed the strategy of
    source file parts lists based on engineering type version numbers
    and the tools to generate them automatically at this time.

GIT does force programmers to version each change by committing them
and forces them to document the change by supplying a commit message.
With standard GIT any changes are identified by the following entities:

    1. The SHA-1 hash of the commit (usually in short form). This
    is the primary identifier of a complete change set or snapshot
    of all files at the time of the commit. Everybody agrees that
    the hash string is useful to extract files but is no good for
    human consumption. I cannot imagine anyone trying to identify a
    version in their mind with a hash string - be it short or long.
    Also hash strings cannot be used for sorting commits.

    2. The date-time of the commit. This string is also a unique
    identifier of a commit (assuming no two commits in one project
    are done in the same second). But again a date-time string to the
    nearest second is rather cumbersome and does not fit easily into
    something humans can and want to use to compare two versions in
    their mind. Date-time strings do have the virtue of allowing the
    sorting of commits into the order they occurred in.

    3. The obligatory commit message the committer has to provide.
    This text may be very useful, but it does depend very much on
    the discipline of the individual user. It can be searched for
    in the 'git log' output and thus lead a later investigator
    to a specific commit. Extra data about a commit is available as
    a comment in the commit message before it is presented to the
    committer, but it is mostly not un-commented.

    4. Optionally any commit may be identified by a 'tag'. The
    text of the tag may be nearly any string. For obvious reasons this
    is often chosen to be an engineering type, full-stop separated
    version number, which everyone is used to and which the mind
    handles easily for identifying and comparing products. A useful
    feature of GIT is the fact that tags may be applied to a commit
    at any time, giving users the means to apply memorable names to
    an otherwise nearly nameless commit entity (Nameless to humans).

    5. As a rule the actual files that have changed and which have
    been committed together in any particular commit are not recorded
    by GIT. The list can only be obtained indirectly by doing a 'git
    diff --name-only' between two commits. Since such a list is not
    available directly trying to grep a set of such lists becomes a
    major exercise in 'on the fly' shell scripting, which I imagine
    would be beyond many programmers. I will show how such a list can
    easily be embedded in each commit message. The lists can then be
    easily grepped in the 'git log'.

Concluding remarks

Special care has been taken that $Id strings imported from legacy RCS,
CVS or SVN repositories are not modified by 'clean' or 'smudge'.
This has been done so that files checked out from GIT historical
commits imported from RCS, CVS or SVN are identical to the same
files checked out from RCS, CVS or SVN and diff correctly with the
GIT historical archive.  $Id: strings from SVN have not been tested,
but should be OK. An example of $Id$ expansion in the SVN book is:
$Id: calc.c 148 2006-07-28 21:30:43Z sally $

The only place where a legacy $Id string is changed to a clean GIT $Id
string, which can subsequently be smudged is in 'pre-commit', where
the minor version number (the whole version number in the case of SVN)
is incremented to continue the sequence.

I said at the beginning of this proposal that my scripts would update
$Id strings in a similar way to that which is carried out in RCS,
CVS or SVN. This is not quite correct. In all the legacy VCSs the
file version number is an attribute of each file in the respective
repository.  In a commit (ci) operation this file version number is
incremented but in the case of RCS and CVS the old $Id string with
the un-incremented version number and the old date is stored in the
repository text. The updated version number and correct commit date
is not visible in a version string until the file is checked out
again (co).  SVN is more careful and stores the unadorned (cleaned)
version string $Id$ in the repository with every commit. Most GIT
implementations of 'clean' and 'smudge' follow the SVN pattern and
make no attempt to generate a numeric version number. They simply
adorn the $Id string with the smudge information.

The fundamental problem is, that GIT does no have a numeric file
version number. Therefore it cannot be generated or incremented in
'smudge' because an independent version number for each file just
does not exist.  The only reasonably way to implement a file version
number in GIT is to generate or increment it in 'pre-commit' and
store it with its up to date file name in the repository, ready for
the next commit. One advantage of this strategy is, that after each
commit the correct file name and correct updated version number is
immediately visible in the $Id strings in files listed with gitk. Only
the specific GIT attributes SHA-1 hash, date and author name are
added to the working copy by 'smudge' on checkout.

An issue which is sometimes raised is the problem which occurs
if a file with $Id versions is modified in separate branches and
subsequently needs to be merged. The version numbers in each branch
will be incremented independently for every file change and commit
in that branch. When those files are merged, the $Id strings will
conflict, but that conflict can be resolved quite easily - just
choose the version applicable to the current branch. This could be
done automatically with a 'pre-merge' hook, but so far GIT does
not have one. So the inconvenience of an occasional manual merge
conflict resolution for $Id versions from different branches is the
only non automatic action imposed on users of this package.

There is nothing special about the version number text in the $Id
string. It can be modified manually to show any version the user deems
appropriate. One manual change which is often made is to increment
the major version number and start again with a low minor version eg
1.47 ==> 2.0. (Remember to keep the minor version in the file about
to be committed one less than what you want it to be after committing).
